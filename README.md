## Introduction  
**TBC (Terminal Based - Anonymous - Communication)** is a simple chat app that runs in the terminal and keeps you completely anonymous.  

You can run your own server on your computer, and others can connect to itâ€”whether they are on the same local network or connecting over the internet.

This setup makes TBC flexible and resilient, perfect for private, secure chats without the usual limits of centralized platforms.

TBC is lightweight, fast, and easy to useâ€”all from your terminal. More features like encrypted messages and easy setup are coming soon.
